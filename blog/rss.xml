                    <p>
                        I'm Nicolei Ocana. The core values that best reflect my identity are
                        community, responsibility, and meaningful work. I poke fun of my 
                        38 years of age; all jest aside, my experiences contributed
                        to how I personify these core values.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The characteristic of community is important because all individuals
                        deserve an equal chance. There are matters that are out of one's
                        control negatively affecting their education, their right to stand
                        up for what they believe in, and informing themselves of what is going
                        on outside of where they live. If I had a chance to bring the
                        community together by offering a resolution to these issues, I would.
                        I cannot be a passive participant while there exists some who are less
                        fortnuate than I am only because they were born in an oppressive environment. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a representative of the older generation, I feel it is important
                        to exhibit charity to help those who are in the same position as I
                        once was: confused and overwhelmed. Web development can be
                        outrageously difficult without the proper guidance. Responsibility is
                        exemplified whenever I have the opportunity to help anyone with a 
                        "noob" question. No one should have to feel threatened when they are
                        simply looking for direction when developing their technological passion.
                        I'm glad to patiently offer my support when someone is stuck; I remember
                        being at that point once and it is my responsibility to offer the same
                        mentorship that I once received.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A job well done is its own reward. Demonstrating meaningful work is projected
                        from volunteering my time, knowing that financial compensation
                        truly isn't the movitating factor to complete any task to the best of my
                        abilities. Any responsibility is met with the same enthusiasm and diligence.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My motivation to apply to Outreachy is to serve as an example that 
                        no matter your age, your educational background, or hardships you face in life,
                        anyone has a chance to achieve their goals. All the hard work, sacrifice, and
                        perseverance will result in accomplishment. Believe in yourself and
                        never give up.
                    </p>
